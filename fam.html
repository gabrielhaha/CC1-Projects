									<h2>My Family</h2></br>
				<p>My family is composed of 5 members. I have one brother and one sister.  I am the oldest of my two siblings.  My Dad is a taxi driver, he only rents the taxi he is using. My dad is hard working man. He drives taxi for 24 hours straight every another day. My mom is a caretaker of a house that our boss owns and most of the time she's at home and taking care of the house chores. She is the most responsible mom I've ever known. My sister is 2 years younger than me. She is currently grade 11 studying at The University of the Cordilleras. She is good in arts not like me. Lastly, my brother which is already 4 years old. He only speak english, taught by youtube which he is always doing. He is a very jolly kid. This is my family, THE GREATEST GIFT FROM GOD I'VE EVER HAD.</p>
