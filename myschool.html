 </br>
<p>Hold high the torch;</br>
Let its blaze reach all corners,</br>
Throughout the world</br>
to lighten the course of darkness.</br>
Keep wise and well not forgetting fidelity,</br>
To our Alma Mater, wherever we may be</br>
Keep our hearts together with glowing</br>
love and loyalty.</br>
</br>
Hold tight the shield,</br>
And defend our dear country</br>
We must not yield</br>
To threats made upon our safety.</br>
This is the pledge</br>
We shall keep till our dying day.</br>
To our Alma Mater, wherever we may be</br>
Keep our hearts together</br>
With glowing love and loyalty.<br/>

		<h1>The History of the University of the Cordilleras</h1></br>
	<p>Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary education in the mountain highlands of the Cordillera region amidst devastation in and around Baguio City after the Second World War.</br></br>
Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate of any undertaking at that time, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he undauntedly pursued a noble mission by founding a college.</br>
</br>
It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic event unfolded. Baguio Colleges was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal arts, with the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held in rented spaces at the Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main thoroughfare.<img src="bc.jpg" align="left"></br>
</br>
1966 became a turning point for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation. Since then, it has blazed new trails and has become more responsive to the needs of the time.
</br>
The founder, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa sat as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and held the reins of the presidency up to the early part of 1994.</br>
</br>
Through the years, the University of the Cordilleras has grown bigger through the offering of additional courses and increasing student enrollment. It continues to grow even better with time, as evidenced by exemplary performance in various fields of discipline, with its graduates shining in national licensure examinations, and its alumni doing well in private employment, in the practice of their trade and profession, and in public service.</br>
</br>
Today, the University of the Cordilleras caters to more than 15,000 students coming from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Regions I and II, as well as from neighboring provinces in Luzon. Course offerings range from graduate studies, law, arts and sciences, nursing, engineering and architecture, commerce and secretarial, teacher education, computer science, technical courses, elementary and high school.</br><img src="ucnow.gif" align="right"></br>

The University's College of Law is rated among the top law schools in the country, having graduated bar topnotchers as of year 2007. The Colleges of Engineering, Criminology, Information and Computer Science, and Teacher Education have gained recognition as among the top colleges in the region and the country. The College of Nursing, although newly-opened, has already shown an optimistic outlook with its exceptional performance in its first ever nursing board examinations.</br>
</br>
The future looks bright for the University of the Cordilleras, and we're glad to be blessed to serve these mountain highlands of the Philippines. Mabuhay!</br>

 	<h1>The Foundation Seal</h1></br>
 	<p><img src="uclogo.png" align="left">The rice terraces, often called the eighth wonder of the world, is a symbol of the genius of our race. They show the industry, patience and skill of the early Filipinos in this part of the highlands where UC is situated.</br>
</br>
The leaves of the pine tree, an evergreen, denote youth and its fresh and courageous outlook.</br>
</br>
The torch, the classical symbol of learning, means that while UC is dedicated to the cultivation of a distinct Filipino culture, it has profited from the teachings of other cultures.</br>
</br>
The shield implies that education, the birthright of everyone, is a protection against the inadequacy, intolerance, and slavery of the mind.</br>

		<p>Up the zigzag road, you will find your way</br>
Leading to the gate of learning,</br>
Give the place some thought, you can't go astray</br>
There is where you'll hear them singing</br>
*** Neath the tall and stalwart pine trees</br>
Our Alma Mater proudly stands;</br>
Over hill and over valleys with full command upon the strand</br>
There is where my mind is nourished</br>
With the wisdom that I need</br>
There is where I reap some knowledge</br>
My heart to strengthen my creed.</br>
***</br>
Hear the murmur of those pine trees</br>
Feel the softness of mountain breeze</br>
If you have some ambition</br>
The right inspiration, you'll find in the Baguio Colleges</br>
(Repeat ***)</p>

	<h1>College of Information Technology and Computer Science</h1></br>
	<p>In 1986, the University of the Cordilleras, then known as the Baguio Colleges Foundation, became the first institution in Baguio City to offer a four-year course in Computer Science. Under the umbrella of the Arts and Sciences, this new division started with barely 100 students, 4 faculty members, and one course offering: Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science.

With its transition from a division to a separate college in June 1995, the College grew to more than 1,200 students and 34 faculty members.

In keeping with the philosophy of the University of the Cordilleras, the College of Information Technology and Computer Science has recognized its responsibility to respond to the changing needs of society, particularly in the field of Information Technology.

The College is aware that today's technology revolves around the indispensability of the computer in the fields of computations, database systems, web & graphics, networking & security, mobile technology and digital arts.

The present courses offered by the College are geared towards bolstering computing competencies, a vital role it plays in the community.

In 2007, CHED Conferred the highest academic status to the college as "Center of Excellence". UC holds the distinction of being among the nation's top nine(9) in IT education.

To fulfill these, the College shall strive to:

<ol><li> Upgrade periodically the Institution's course offerings focusing on innovative tools, current trends, and industry requirements;</li>
<li> Prepare the student to apply his/her acquired academic skills to his/her related profession with commitment and dedication;</li>

<li> Excel in the use of Information Technology (IT) facilities, their prototypes and development, including evaluations and tests; and</li>
